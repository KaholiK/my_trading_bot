# Writer's Coach & Human-Typer Monorepo

A production-ready TypeScript monorepo delivering two ethical writing tools:

1. **Writer's Coach** ‚Äî Paraphraser + Humanizer (Ethical, Academic-Safe)
2. **Human-Typer** ‚Äî Chrome MV3 extension that types text with human-like rhythm

## ‚ú® Features

### Writer's Coach (Web App)
- **Ethical Paraphrasing**: Improves clarity and natural flow while preserving meaning
- **Citation Lock**: Automatically protects citations from modification
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time readability, sentence variety, passive voice analysis
- **History & Diff**: Token-level comparison between revisions
- **Export**: DOCX and PDF generation
- **Privacy First**: Supabase RLS, no telemetry, export/delete your data

### Human-Typer (Chrome Extension)
- **Natural Typing**: Log-normal delay distribution with micro-pauses
- **Style Presets**: Casual, Fast, Careful, Phone typing patterns
- **Configurable**: Speed, variability, punctuation pauses, error rate
- **Standard Mode**: Works on inputs, textareas, and contentEditable
- **Driver Mode** (optional): Uses Chrome debugger API for stubborn editors
- **Privacy**: Settings only, no data persisted

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **pnpm** >= 8.0.0
- **Supabase** account (free tier works)
- **OpenAI** API key (or use mock provider for testing)

### Installation

```bash
# Install pnpm globally if needed
npm install -g pnpm

# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/KaholiK/my_trading_bot.git
cd my_trading_bot
pnpm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase and OpenAI credentials
````

### Development

```bash
# Run all apps in development mode
pnpm dev

# Or run individually
pnpm --filter api dev      # API server on :3001
pnpm --filter web dev      # Web app on :3000
pnpm --filter extension dev # Extension build

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Seed database
pnpm seed
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build all apps
pnpm build

# Start in production mode
pnpm start
```

### Loading the Chrome Extension

1. Build the extension: `pnpm --filter extension build`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `apps/extension/dist` directory

## üìÅ Monorepo Structure

```
/apps
  /api         # NestJS backend (REST API)
  /web         # Next.js frontend (App Router)
  /extension   # Chrome MV3 extension
/packages
  /llm         # LLM provider abstraction (OpenAI, Mock)
  /metrics     # Readability & style metrics with tests
  /ui          # Shared React components
  /shared      # Zod schemas, types, constants
/tooling       # Shared TypeScript & ESLint configs
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **No Telemetry**: Zero third-party analytics or tracking
- **Supabase RLS**: Users can only access their own data
- **No Secrets in Code**: Environment variables only
- **Data Portability**: Export all your data as JSON
- **Right to Deletion**: Delete all your data with one click
- **Guardrails**: Blocks requests to evade detection tools

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

This tool **refuses** to help with:

- Bypassing AI detectors
- Evading plagiarism detection
- Cheating academic integrity systems
- Making content "undetectable"

If such requests are detected, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Not supported. This app improves clarity and style while preserving meaning and citations."
}
```

## üìä Metrics Definitions

### Readability

**Flesch Reading Ease** = `206.835 - 1.015 * (words/sentences) - 84.6 * (syllables/words)`

- Higher score = easier to read
- 90-100: Very easy (5th grade)
- 60-70: Standard (8th-9th grade)
- 0-30: Very difficult (college graduate)

### Sentence Length Variance

Variance of sentence lengths (measured in words per sentence). Higher variance indicates more structural diversity.

### Repetition Ratio

`unique bigrams / total bigrams` (0 to 1)

- Lower ratio = more repetitive phrasing
- Higher ratio = more lexical variety

### Passive Voice %

`(# of passive sentences / total sentences) * 100`
Detected using "be verb + past participle" heuristic.

### Lexical Diversity

`unique tokens / total tokens` (0 to 1)
Type-token ratio measuring vocabulary richness.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter @writers-coach/metrics test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

## üìù API Documentation
