# Part 9: Chat Interface & Credentials Handling
#
# This module sets up a basic FastAPI backend to:
# - Accept API keys or credentials via a POST request
# - Accept chat messages
# - Integrate with the LLM to answer questions
# - Allow user to specify which exchange/broker to use by selecting from available ones
#
# We'll expand this with more robust authentication, storage, and a frontend in future parts.
